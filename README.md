Lab 3 of programming and algo course of Lviv Polytechnic National University on Internet of Things.

This is a program that subtracts one array from another and returns the result to the console.
In brief, it removes all values from list A that are in list B, keeping them in order.

You should initialize two arrays, at least with 1 element, in the beginning of the code in "Arrays initialization" field.

Enjoy!
